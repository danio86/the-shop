# TheShop

The Shop is a platform where users can upload and sell real estate properties. Once a property is created, the owner can edit and delete it. Other users can view the properties and make inquiries. These inquiries can also be edited and deleted. Additionally, there is an 'Interested' button that users can click. This allows the property owner to see that their property is of interest to others and potentially initiate contact. The entire platform can also be filtered for interesting properties.

The Project can be seen [here](https://theshop.herokuapp.com/)

## Deployment

The project was deployed using Code institut's mock for Heroku

    Steps for deployment:
        This repository was cloned.
        A Herroku app was created.
        Added config vars for the secret key, for cloudinary and for the posgresql database.
        The Heroku app was linked to the repository
        Deploy was clicked.
